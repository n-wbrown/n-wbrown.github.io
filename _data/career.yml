      description: >
        I developed software and hardware for the LCLS-II upgrade and instruments for the Time-resolved Molecular and Optical (TMO) endstation. I created a backend Grafana plugin for monitoring EPICS based installations and wrote Pytmc for automating parts of the PLC development processes. During this time I also designed vacuum control systems using Beckhoff PLCs while commissioning and overseeing multiple teams of contractors. I lead the development and commissioning of TMO's third endstation, the Multi-resolution Cookiebox Optimized for the Future of Free Electron laser Experiments (MRCOFFEE).

          - to: May 2016
            from: March 2015
        description: >
          I designed and built a portable, WiFi controlled, environment vibration monitor (VATS) for the detector fabrication cleanroom including sensor interfaces for the High Energy Experimental Physics in collaboration with LHCb. This project included the analysis package for significant frequency detection, intelligent peak grouping, and user-friendly tools for data presentation. I also streamlined testing procedures by automating testing equipment.
